# MainProjects, Knowledge & Tos
This is for my main, serious projects
I made this with the idea of giving the people of the coding world of lua/luau that they can achieve as such as I do.

-- tos --
No taking my code and adding anything to it that gives you personal benefit in any/way shape or form except for advertisment (youtube, tiktok ect) | Code 1
No changing or malforming my code in a way that makes it malfunctional, malicious and any of the sort | Code 2
Permitted to fork, copy, and take the code for a backup of it. | Code 3
No doing Code 3 and claiming that these scripts are yours.
